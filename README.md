### Hi there 👋

I'm an iOS developer at EPAM.

🔭 I’m currently working on on [Gymber](https://github.com/GymberClub), and a couple of home projects - a [photoshoot's details web form on Flutter](https://github.com/CoolONEOfficial/photoform) and another secret project 🤫

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a member of Worldskills national team in the competence of mobile apps development.
